This project was way more complicated than I imagined it to be.
Turtle library was really limiting on things that could be done and I had 
to constantly go back to the documentation.
My game mainly runs on a class called GameBoard which handles the 
gui.
Every setting that is needed to manipulate the game is in settings.py
It creates a Puzzle instance which handles all the logic for the puzzle.
The puzzle is a nested list containing turtles that are assigned for each image Piece
on the board. 
After every click, the puzzle checks for win and if its not a win, it continues.
After a win, the leaders are stored into a leaders.data file using the pickle library. I did it
with normal file handling in python but it just seemed better and faster to use pickle.

After I was done with most of my project, I really was interested to integrate a game 
called League of Legends into the project. When I tried adding the images and such to it, 
it took me forever to get the names, puz file, image sizing etc right for it to work, even for just 1 image

So I wrote a python script for it which does all the things that are required to integrate an image as a puzzle in the game.

Now I can just take a random screenshot or image and put it in the "screenshots" folder and just run the script.py and thats it.
It just integrates it directly and I dont have to do anything after that. You can try it out with your images. 

My plan is it integrate images from instagram directly by just putting in the instagram username now.

This was a fun project and taught me a lot!
